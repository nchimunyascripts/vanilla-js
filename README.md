# JavaScript Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript examples and exercises covering fundamental concepts, DOM manipulation, and a simple game.

## Contents

### 1. Core JavaScript Fundamentals

- **0-variables.js**: Covers variable declarations and basic data types:
  - `let`, `const`, `var` declarations
  - Primitive types (numbers, strings, booleans)
  - Type coercion and conversion
  - Variable scoping

- **1-strings.js**: Demonstrates string manipulation:
  - String creation and concatenation
  - Template literals
  - Common string methods (length, indexOf, slice, replace, etc.)
  - String formatting and case conversion

- **2-arrays.js**: Array operations and methods:
  - Array creation and initialization
  - Adding/removing elements
  - Iteration methods (forEach, map, filter, reduce)
  - Searching and sorting
  - Multi-dimensional arrays

- **3-objects.js**: Object manipulation including:
  - Creating and accessing objects
  - Adding/updating/deleting properties
  - Object iteration and transformation
  - JSON conversion
  - Object methods (keys, values, entries)

### 2. Intermediate JavaScript Concepts

- **4-objects.js**: Advanced object operations (see previous description)
- **5-loops.js**: Looping constructs (see previous description)
- **6-condition.js**: Conditional logic (see previous description)
- **7-functions.js**: Function examples (see previous description)
- **8-oop.js**: Object-oriented programming (see previous description)

### 3. DOM Manipulation

- **9-dom.html**: HTML structure for DOM examples
- **9-dom.js**: DOM manipulation techniques (see previous description)
- **9-styles.css**: Styling for the DOM examples

### 4. Guess Game

- **100-guess_game.html**: Simple HTML page for the game
- **100-guess_game.js**: Number guessing game (see previous description)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open HTML files in a browser for DOM examples and the game
3. Run JS files directly or in browser console for core concepts:
   - Start with 0-variables.js for fundamentals
   - Progress through 1-strings.js, 2-arrays.js, etc.
4. For the guess game:
   - Open 100-guess_game.html in browser
   - Use browser console to play

## Learning Path

1. Begin with fundamental concepts:
   - Variables and data types (0-variables.js)
   - String operations (1-strings.js)
   - Array methods (2-arrays.js)
   - Object basics (3-objects.js)

2. Move to intermediate topics:
   - Advanced objects (4-objects.js)
   - Loops and iteration (5-loops.js)
   - Conditional logic (6-condition.js)
   - Functions (7-functions.js)
   - OOP (8-oop.js)

3. Practice with DOM manipulation (9- files)
4. Apply knowledge with the guess game (100- files)

Note: The files are numbered to suggest a recommended learning order, but can be explored in any sequence based on your learning needs.
